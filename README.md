# ❤️ For skidders
I know that some people will skid some effects after I release APM 08279-5255.exe's source code to put in their malwares, and even if I complain about it, nothing will change... 

So for that reason I added a `GPLv3 license`. In other words, <b>if you use/modify a part of my code, you need to make your project open source and give me credit!</b>
<br> but the MBR code is not made by me and is licensed with the more permissive MIT License, in other words, if you want to use the MBR, credit https://github.com/littleli, NOT ME!!!
